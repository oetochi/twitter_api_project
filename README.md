# PROJECT TITLE
## DATA WRANGLING OF WERATEDOGS TWITTER ACCOUNT
# INTRODUCTION
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python and its libraries, I will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. I will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries) and/or SQL.

The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.


## About WeRateDogs Twitter Account
> "This is Miya and Kiyo. You never know when someone might need a hug, so Miya tries to be proactive about it. Kiyo stays available for quality control. 13/10 for both" - [Image Source](https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/1557852264026361856)

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. The account was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media attention both for its popularity and for the attention drawn to social media copyright law when it was suspended by Twitter for breaking these aforementioned laws - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs)
